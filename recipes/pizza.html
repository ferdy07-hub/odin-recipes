        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg of soft wheat flour type 0</li>
            <li>800ml of room temperature water</li>
            <li>5g of brewer's yeast</li>
            <li>30ml of extra virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>25 of table salt</li>
            <li>1kg of peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>600g of mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>basil just enough</li>
            <li>Grana Padano cheese 70g</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl mix the flour with the brewer's yeast and then puor the water.</li>
            <li>Gently combine until there is no dry flour left. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, poke holes to let it breathe, and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.</li>
            <li>After resting, cut the preferment into pieces and place them back in the bowl with water to soften the top layer.</li>
            <li>Add flour and yeast, and start mixing the dough.</li>
            <li>Once the water is absorbed, add the salt and mix from top to bottom. Then add the oil and knead until fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough back in the bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature. </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions using a dough scraper. Shape each into a ball and place them in a proofing box or tray. Let rise for about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: crush peeled tomatoes by hand, season with olive oil, salt, and fresh basil.</li>
            <li>Slice the mozzarella into strips and grate the Grana Padano cheese.</li>
            <li>After rising, lightly flour a dough ball and press it from the center outwards to push the air into the crust.</li>
            <li>Flip the dough and repeat. Stretch it into a 28 cm disc by gently pulling and slapping it.</li>
            <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly, leaving the edges clear.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with grated Grana Padano and distribute the mozzarella. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza onto a peel and bake at 250°C (or maximum temperature) on a preheated pizza stone for 5–7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once baked, slide the pizza onto a plate, garnish with fresh basil, and serve immediately!</li>
