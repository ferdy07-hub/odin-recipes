        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tiramisu is an Italian dessert made of ladyfinger pastries (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks, sugar, and mascarpone, and topped with cocoa powder. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200 g (7 oz) spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Chili pepper (fresh or dried, to taste)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Coarse salt (for the pasta water)</li>
            <li>(Optional) Fresh chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a pan with sliced garlic and chili pepper.</li>
            <li>Once the garlic is golden, turn off the heat to prevent it from burning.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta (save a bit of cooking water) and add it to the pan.</li>
            <li>Toss the spaghetti in the oil for a minute, adding a spoonful of cooking water if needed. Serve immediately, with chopped parsley if desired!</li>
