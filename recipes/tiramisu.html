            <li>Mascarpone cheese 3 ⅓ cups (750 g) </li>
            <li>Ladyfingers 8.75 oz (250 g) </li>
            <li>Coffee 1 ⅓ cup (300 g) - (made in a moka pot, with sugar to taste)	</li>
            <li>Eggs 5 (260 g) - (very fresh, medium)</li>
            <li>Sugar ⅔ cup (120 g)</li>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder to taste </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Brew about 1¼ cups (300 g) of coffee using a moka pot. Add sugar to taste (about 1 teaspoon) and let it cool in a large, shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Separate the eggs, making sure no yolk gets into the whites.</li>
            <li>Beat the yolks with half of the sugar using a hand mixer until light and foamy.</li>
            <li>While mixing, gradually add the mascarpone to the yolk mixture until you get a thick, smooth cream.</li>
            <li>Wash and dry the beaters, then whip the egg whites until foamy.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the remaining sugar while whipping the whites to stiff peaks.</li>
            <li>Add a spoonful of whipped egg whites to the mascarpone cream and stir vigorously to loosen the mixture.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the remaining egg whites, mixing from the bottom up to keep the cream light and airy.</li>
            <li>Spread a generous spoonful of mascarpone cream on the bottom of a 9x13 inch (20x30 cm) dish to cover the base.</li>
            <li>Quickly dip ladyfingers into the cooled coffee on both sides.</li>
            <li>Arrange the soaked ladyfingers in the dish, all in the same direction, to form the first layer.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of mascarpone cream and level it evenly over the ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layering: dipped ladyfingers, then cream, smoothing each layer as you go.</li>
            <li>Transfer the remaining cream to a piping bag with a ½-inch (12 mm) plain tip and decorate the top with small dabs.</li>
            <li>Dust the surface with unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the tiramisu for at least a couple of hours before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve chilled and enjoy your homemade tiramisu!</li>
